== Usage ==

Security Guard contains 30+ separate security tests. Once you click the "Run Tests" button all tests will be run. Depending on various parameters of your site this can take from ten seconds to 2-3 minutes. Please don't reload the page until testing is done.

If no test results show up after the page reloads or you get a "Bad AJAX response" please configure max script execution time.

Each test comes with a detailed explanation which you should use to determine whether it affects your site or not. Most test have simple to follow instructions on how to strengthen your site's security. Please read the instruction carefully and follow them only if you feel comfortable doing so.

**Configuring maximum script execution time**

In order to minimize the impact on your server Security Guard has a limit on the maximum number of seconds it's tests can run. If you have a very slow server there may be a need to increase this limit.

If you want to increase this limit open security-guard.php and change the line #21 which defines it.

<code>
// maximum number of seconds tests are allowed to run
define('THEMO_SG_MAX_EXEC_SEC', 200);
</code>

**Configuring maximum number of user accounts to perform brute-force attacks on**

By default Security Guard tests only the first 25 users (starting from administrators) when doing brute-force attacks. This limit is imposed to be sure we don't kill the database while doing the attack.

If you want to test more or all users open security-guard.php and change the line #20 which defines this limit.

<code>
// maximum number of user accounts that are brute-force tested for weak passwords
define('THEMO_SG_MAX_USERS_ATTACK', 25);
