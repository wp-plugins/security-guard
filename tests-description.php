      <td><p>Keeping the WordPress core up to date is one of the most important aspects of keeping your site secure. If vulnerabilities are discovered in WordPress and a new version is released to address the issue, the information required to exploit the vulnerability is almost certainly in the public domain. This makes old versions more open to attacks, and is one of the primary reasons you should always keep WordPress up to date.</p>
      <p>Thanks to automatic updates updating is very easy. Just go to <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a> and click "Upgrade". <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p></td>

These are usually security fixes that don't alter WP in any significant way and should be applied as soon as WP releases them.</p>
      <p>Updates can be disabled via constants in <i>wp-config.php</i> or by a plugin. For details please see <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates" target="_blank">WP Codex</a>.</p></td>

Since most plugins are free and therefore their code is available to anyone having the latest version will ensure you're not prone to attacks based on known vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>If you downloaded a plugin from the official WP repository you can easily check if there are any upgrades available, and upgrade it by opening <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a>. If you bought the plugin from CodeCanyon be sure to check the item's page and upgrade manually. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p></td>

However disclosing the full WP version info in the default location (page header meta) is not wise. People with bad intentions can easily use Google to find site's that use a specific version of WordPress and target them with 0-day exploits.</p>
      <p>Place the following code in your theme's <i>functions.php</i> file in order to remove the header meta version info:</p>

      <p>This is a very easy problem to solve. Rename the file to something more unique like "readme-876.html"; delete it; move it to another location or chmod it so that it's not accessible via HTTP.</p>

      <p><a href="user-new.php">Create a new user</a> and assign him the "administrator" role. Try not to use usernames like: "root", "god", "null" or similar ones. Once you have the new user created delete the "admin" one and assign all post/pages he may have created to the new user.</p>

      <p>Solution to this problem is simple. Whether user enters wrong username or wrong password we always tell him "wrong username or password" so that he doesn't know which of two is wrong. Open your theme's <i>functions.php</i> file and copy/paste the following code:</p>
      <pre>function wrong_login() {

      <p>Security keys (there are eight) are defined in <i>wp-config.php</i> as constants on lines #45-52. They should be as unique and as long as possible.

      <p>To change the database password open cPanel, Plesk or some other hosting control panel you have. Find the option to change the database password and be sure you make the new password strong enough. If you can't find that option or you're uncomfortable changing it contact your hosting provider. After the password is changed open wp<i>-config.php</i> and change the password on line #25:</p>

Since WP table names are predefined the only way you can change table names is by using a unique prefix. One that's different from "wp_" or any similar variation such as "wordpress_".</p>
      <p>If you're doing a fresh installation defining a unique table prefix is easy. Open <i>wp-config.php</i> and go to line #61 where the table prefix is defined. Enter something unique like "frog99_" and install WP.</p>
      <p>If you already have WP site running and want to change the table prefix things are a bit more complicated and you should only do the change if you're comfortable doing some changes to your DB data via phpMyAdmin or a similar GUI. Detailed 6-step instruction can be found on <a href="http://tdot-blog.com/wordpress/6-simple-steps-to-change-your-table-prefix-in-wordpress">Tdot blog</a>. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before making any changes to the database!</p>

      <td id="mysql_external">Check if MySQL server is connectable from outside with the WP user.</td>
      <td><p>Since MySQL username and password are written in plain-text in <i>wp-config.php</i> it's advisable not to allow any client to use that account unless he's connecting to MySQL from your server (localhost). Allowing him to connect from any host will make some attacks easier to bad people.</p>
      <p>Fixing this issue involves changing the MySQL user or server config and it's not something that can be described in a few words so we advise asking someone to fix it for you. If you're really eager to do it we suggest creating a new MySQL user and under "hostname" enter "localhost". Set other properties such as username and password to your own liking and, of course, update <i>wp-config.php</i> with the new user details.</p>

Please note that for most sites this is not a security issue because they "want to be discovered" but if you want to hide the fact that you're using WP this is the way to go.</p>
      <p>Open your theme's <i>functions.php</i> file and add the following line:</p>
      <pre>remove_action('wp_head', 'rsd_link');</pre>
      <p>Additionally, to completely disable XML-RPC functions put the following code in <i>wp-config.php</i> just below the  <i>require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');</i> line:</p>
      <pre>add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');</pre>
      <p>And also add this code to <i>.htaccess</i> to prevent DDoS attacks:
      <pre>&lt;Files xmlrpc.php&gt;
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre>

      Contact the theme developer and have him update the theme. It's unlikely you'll be able to fix this issue yourself.</p>
